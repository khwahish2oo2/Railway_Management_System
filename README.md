# Railway_Management_System
The railway management system facilitates the passengers to enquire about the trains available on the basis of source and destination, booking and cancellation of tickets, enquire about the status of the booked ticket, etc. This aims to design and develop a database maintaining the records of different trains, stations, and passengers.
